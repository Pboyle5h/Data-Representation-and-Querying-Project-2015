##Introduction

This project is Based on designing an app for [Apps4gaps](http://apps4gaps.ie/) using one of their datasets. 

The app i intend on designing is a forign exchange app designed primarally so that you can go on at anytime and view what the euro is worth against other currencies all over the world. 

There will also be a window in which the user can view what the exchange rate has been for the previous five days, monthly average and anual average. 


##Dataset
The dataset I am going to use for this app is [Exchange Rates](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/exchange-rates/). The dataset has five databases that I will be using.
